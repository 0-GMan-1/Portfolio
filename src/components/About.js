            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Graham, just a guy with an extreme passion for programming,
                specifically, Web 3.0. Web3 is the future and I want to be apart of
                building that future. If you were to hire me for your project or company, you
                are hiring somebody who has an extremely logical mindset but at the
                same time a creative one. I am not afraid of implementing or trying something new
                and taking your project to the next level
            </p>
